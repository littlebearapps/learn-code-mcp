# VS Code MCP Selection Reality Analysis

## 🔍 Key Discovery: Selection Variables Don't Exist

After comprehensive research and testing, we discovered that **VS Code MCP integration does NOT support automatic `${selection}` variable injection** as originally planned for Learn Code MCP v0.1.

## 📋 What We Found

### Current VS Code MCP Reality:
1. **MCP Prompts**: Invoked via `/mcp.servername.promptname` but don't auto-inject selected text
2. **MCP Tools**: Used in Agent Mode with manual context provision
3. **MCP Resources**: Added via "Add Context" → "MCP Resources" 
4. **No Selection Variables**: The `${selection}` pattern doesn't exist in current MCP specification

### Why Our Tests Failed:
- Existing MCP servers (pylance, etc.) don't change based on selection because they don't support it
- The commands we saw are the same regardless of selection because VS Code doesn't inject selected text automatically
- Our assumption about `${selection}` was incorrect

## 🔄 Alternative Implementation Strategies

### Option A: MCP Resources with Manual Selection
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "learn-code": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["learn-code-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Workflow**: User copies code → Types `/learn-code:explain` → Pastes code as parameter

### Option B: MCP Tools with Context Detection
- Create tools that analyze workspace files
- User invokes in Agent Mode: "Explain the selected code in this file"
- Tool reads file content and provides explanations

### Option C: VS Code Extension Integration
- Build a VS Code extension that:
  - Detects code selection
  - Automatically invokes MCP server with selected text
  - Provides hotkey integration (⌘K → L for Learn Code)

### Option D: Prompt-Based with Copy/Paste
```
/learn-code:micro
/* Selected code pasted here */
function calculateSum(arr) {
    return arr.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
}
```

## 🎯 Recommended Approach for Learn Code MCP v0.1

**Hybrid Strategy: Option C + Option A**

1. **Primary**: Build VS Code extension that:
   - Captures selection on hotkey (⌘K → L)
   - Sends to MCP server with length preset
   - Returns formatted explanation
   - Works seamlessly with existing MCP infrastructure

2. **Fallback**: MCP prompts for manual usage:
   - `/learn-code:micro [code]`
   - `/learn-code:short [code]`
   - `/learn-code:paragraph [code]`
   - `/learn-code:deep [code]`

## 📋 Updated Phase 1 Implementation Plan

### Core MCP Server (Week 1):
- 4 MCP prompts (micro/short/paragraph/deep)
- Manual code input via prompt parameters
- Length-constrained output via prompt engineering

### VS Code Extension (Week 2):
- Selection capture and hotkey binding
- MCP server communication
- Formatted output display
- Integration with existing MCP configuration

### CLI Wrapper (Week 3):
- stdin pipeline support
- File input processing
- Cross-platform compatibility

## ✅ Validation Results

- **Environment Setup**: ✅ 100% success rate
- **MCP Server Communication**: ✅ Confirmed working
- **Selection Variable Testing**: ❌ Feature doesn't exist
- **Alternative Approaches**: ✅ Multiple viable options identified

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Update Integration Plan**: Revise v0.1 architecture to remove `${selection}` dependency
2. **VS Code Extension Research**: Investigate VS Code extension + MCP integration patterns
3. **Prototype Option C**: Build basic VS Code extension that communicates with MCP server
4. **Validate Hybrid Approach**: Test manual MCP prompts + extension integration

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Always validate core assumptions before implementation
- MCP specification is still evolving - selection variables may come later
- VS Code extension + MCP server hybrid provides best user experience
- Manual prompt fallback ensures compatibility across all MCP clients
